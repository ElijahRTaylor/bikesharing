# bikesharing

## Overview 

In an effort to see if a bikesharing model would work in a city like Des Moine, Iowa, we are analyzing data from the NYC Citi Bike Program.  Using the data we want to discover more about the bike users, the locations of the bike stations, as well as the time frames the bikes are being taken out for.  By learning from the NYC CitiBike Data, we're hopoing that we will be able to pitch this to investors in order to roll out a very similar product in Des Moine.

The first thing we see is that the of the riders, the majority of them are made up of users who are subscribers.  This is good because subscribers are reoccuring customers.

When we create a visualization to see the amount of rides started at certain locations, we see that they all tend to be near a central location.  This most likely relates to being near business districts, shopping districts, and places where people generally work.

We see a similar display when we show the data with the end stations.  We can infer from this that most people end their bike trips in Manhatan.

When we create our visualization to display the length of time that the bikes are checked out for, we see that the bikes are generally returned within an hour.

The same holds true even when we filter the chart by gender.

When we create a visualization to show the amount of trips by the weekday and the hour, we see that the most popular times these bikes are being used are during the rush hour periods.

It becomes even more evident when we look at the visualiztion that breaks this data down by subscribers and one-off customers.

## Summary

After looking at this data, we can have the following takeaways.

1.In order for the bike sharing program to be extremely successful, bike stations need to be in high traffic areas.  As we can see from the NYC Citibike Data, you will need more bike stations in busy areas not only to accommodate riders who will start their trip there, but to accommodate riders who will end their trip there.

2.Generally riders don't appear to need bikes for longer than an hour.  If a pricing model is added in that incentivizes riders to keep their trips under a certain amount of time, it will help facilitate with bikes being more readily available for the next user.

3.The majority of bike rides appear to be taken by subscribers during the morning and evening rush hours.  This most likely means that subscribers are fully committed to using these bikes to get to and from work on a daily basis.  It may be extremely beneficial to keep these bike stations near places with large workforces.

Some additional visualizations that would also be helpful would be to create a pie chart that showed the amount of rides taken by users of various age group demographics.  We could create a Calculation that would grouup users by age buckets such as 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, etc.  This would allow us to know if this is something that could be comparable to that of the population of Des Moine.  

Another great visualization that could help us would be if we created a line graph that compared age to length of average ride.
